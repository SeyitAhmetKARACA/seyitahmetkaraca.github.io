<br>   Linus Torvalds met computer with his grandfather.His grandfather was an professor in Helsinki University.When Linus twelve , he helped his grandfather’s job on computer.After grandfather wrote code on paper , Linus transfered to computer because there wasn’t enough technology in order to write a computer program directly.Also Linus loved this job ,to. This job made a sensation to Linus. His personality is different from other twelve-year old kids. He was wondered how he learn toy’s operating logic intead of play.Following days, he started to read user guide and he wrote his first own simple computer program. It’s clearly seen that even as a boy ,everyone predicted that he would succeed programming because he code day after day.He didn’t lost his interest to computer programming next years.

After Linus completed hight school degree , he entered Helsinki University to become computer engineer.Computer in Helsinki University used Unix operating system. Unix seems complex and doesn’t end user system but it’s actually simple. He joined a Unix course. The course hadn’t enough facilities, so they didn’t have the hardware. Although , Linus liked Unix , he had some problems with Unix. He bought a operating system book that written by Andrew Tanenbaum. Also this book included Andres Tanenbaum’s academic study with minix that like Unix.Linus decided to buy a computer to try to Minix because his current computer couldn’t run Minix. He saved money for a year and he bought a computer including intel cpu.He had experienced intel cpu and minix operating system. Also , he learnt how computer is running due to his new computer. Although , he used Minix clearly , he had some problem with Minix.He didn’t like some software such as terminal bucause of useless. He decied to rewrite this program like terminal.Actually, Linus wrote terminal but what makes this terminal different from minix’s terminal is Linus’s terminal running hardware. It didn’t need any operating system and advanture of Linux had begun in this way. He added some properties and released in university’s network. Many people downloaded and gave feedback to him. His operating system was ready in the end. He wanted to release first stable operating system called ‘Freax’ because Linux was his working name, so if he had used Linux , people would have thought Linus was egomaniac. He gave name ‘Freax’.However , Ari Lemmke used his working name instead of ‘Freax’ and he couldn’t change it.

<br>Today, hobby of Linus’s product is Linux that used by big companies because Linux is using everywhere. İf someone use technology , he/she use Linux because Linux is our part of life such as smartphones , smart TVs. Also , the biggest companies ,which leader of internet , using Linux such as Google, Twitter, Facebook , Amazon.

<br>There are a lot of various Linux version. People ,who working different jobs, developing Linux to their own job.For example , ubuntu is developed for last user and it is still developing like other Linux versions.In addition , Linux versions has different versions in itself such as ubuntu, kubuntu, lubuntu, xubuntu. All of them based Linux kernel but prefering from users and property of cumputer limiting. For example, if your computer’s hardware properties was low , you would install lubuntu because lubuntu didn’t need hight hardware.if you wanted to good graphic , you would install ubuntu , so people ,who using computer or smartphone, can select Linux versions as far as their neccessity.

As a result , Linus Torvalds claim one’s place in history with Linux. The most of technology ,which used by people , are running due to Linus Torvalds’ hobby clearly.He is still working on Linux.He wants to improve Linux in order to he opened Linux’s source code. In other words , Linux is free to understand to how computer running and learn freedom in computer. Tos um up , our technology improved with Linus’s interest and we must to be insterest our future.
